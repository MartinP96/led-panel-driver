# led-panel-driver
Simple project of a hex panel led strip driver. Led driver is based on Atmel Atmega8 controller. We are also using a realtime clock module for tracking time. 
For communication with RTC module we are using I2C protocol. Led panels were designed in SolidWorks and 3d printed with Creality CR10 3d printer.

The final design is shown in image below:
